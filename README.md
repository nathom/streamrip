By default, `qobuz-dl` will skip already downloaded items by ID with the message `This release ID ({item_id}) was already downloaded`. To avoid this check, add the flag `--no-db` at the end of a command. In extreme cases (e.g. lost collection), you can run `qobuz-dl -p` to completely reset the database.

from qobuz_dl.core import QobuzDL

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

email = "your@email.com"
password = "your_password"

qobuz = QobuzDL()
qobuz.get_tokens() # get 'app_id' and 'secrets' attrs
qobuz.initialize_client(email, password, qobuz.app_id, qobuz.secrets)

qobuz.handle_url("https://play.qobuz.com/album/va4j3hdlwaubc")
